# DIY_arduinoLeonardoEgoVersion
This PCB is an Atmega32u4 based microcontroller board. It can be flashed so that it reports as an Arduino Leonardo or Pro Micro. I am using it in multiple projects like a sim racing wheel for example. The files where created with Altium 18. Step file and gerber files can be found in the repository as well.

This is NOT considered to be an open-source project. Thus any commercial use is prohibited by the owner. Copying and mofying the files for private use is permitted.
